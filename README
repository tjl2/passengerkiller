Use this script to kill off all running Passenger instances.

This is useful if you find that a standard Passenger restart is leaving old instances lying around.

Perfect for use in an after_restart capistrano/engineyard deploy hook.

NOTE: This is a quick hack put together to work on Engineyard AppCloud and it assumes your app lives in /data/ and the owner of that app is the owner of the Passenger processes.

Example usage:
  passengerkiller appname

When using Rails 3, you will likely need to specify "-f rack":
  passengerkiller appname -f rack
